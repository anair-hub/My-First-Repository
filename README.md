# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
   Kickstarter was a platform available to help artists raise funds to promote creative arts. There were also projects implemented to raise funds for new product launches as well.

### Purpose
   This project is to help Louise kickstart play production by finding out trends of how campaigns fared and outcomes based on  launched dates and funding goals.
  

## Analysis and Challenges
   In order to get to looking at the trends, there were some preliminary steps done like getting the year projection from launched date. Parent and Sub category were also split into 2 columns to use for furthur drill down. Percentage funded was then calculated using the goals and pledged dollar amount.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on  Date
   Using the projected year, we were able to get an idea that May was the month where maximum success outcome occurred and that there was steap decline from october into decemeber months.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

   ![] (/Resources/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png)

   Funding goals within the range from 1000 to 50000 happened to have maximum success outcome. Next best was with amount less than 1000 and was observed that as the amount increased, success was very negligible.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
    Since dataset was available only till 2017 year, no current date analysis was possible. Initially I had issue creating Pivot tables as i had to play around with the dataset. I then read through the instructions and then broke it down to further data segments which helped me completed the analysis.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
  May month was observed to have maximum success rate of launching a theater campaign and there seemed to be a decline during months of October, November and December.
  
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
   Maximum success was observed for campaigns with funding goals between $1000 and $5000

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
    Combination of theater and plays data set was very limited

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
    Using the same parent category and furthur drill down to all subcategory levels would have helped in getting a comparison analysis.
